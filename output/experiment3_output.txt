Experiment 3: 4-Player Table Composition Analysis
Testing H3: Strategy performance depends on opponent composition (θ)
======================================================================

Running 10 trials per composition (5 compositions)
Each trial consists of 20 rounds
Total trials: 50
Total rounds: 1000

Running composition θ=0 (0 DEF, 4 AGG)...
Running composition θ=1 (1 DEF, 3 AGG)...
Running composition θ=2 (2 DEF, 2 AGG)...
Running composition θ=3 (3 DEF, 1 AGG)...
Running composition θ=4 (4 DEF, 0 AGG)...

INTERPRETATION
======================================================================

❌ H3 Not Supported: Aggressive strategy profit DECREASES as θ increases
   (More defensive opponents → Worse aggressive performance)
